## Product Classification & Product Matching using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

The following project provides a toolkit consisting of tuned Deep Convolutional Neural 
Networks in order to classify product images in 3 different tasks (brand, category, product line). It also allows 
for the matching of identical products by extracting the embeddings of their 
images.

Installationdocs
=========

In order to establish the basic infrastructure for running this project, you will need
to follow a set of steps which can be found [here](docs/Installation.md)

Data Acquisition
=========

The project requires the data to be formatted in a specific way. For the easier 
acquisition of such a structure one can run the crawler.py file attached to this 
project. Further details are revealed by clicking [here](docs/Data_acquisition.md)

Execution
=========

The project has a plethora of commands used for the processes of product 
classification and matching. The aforementioned commands can be found
